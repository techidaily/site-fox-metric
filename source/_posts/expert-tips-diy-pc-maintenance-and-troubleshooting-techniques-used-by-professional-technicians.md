If your hard drive is almost full, then your computer is not going to work fast. You can also consider upgrading to SSDs; they are faster than HDD. Your computer saves some temporary files; sometimes when the PC has lots of temporary files it slows down, so delete the temporary files. To do that press the **Windows** button and **R** together to open the run dialogue. Now type **%temp%** and press **enter**.![Delete Temporary Files 1](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Delete-Temporary-Files-1.jpg)You will see the temporary file window, now **select all files** and the press **Shift key & Del** button together.

## Removing Malware or Virus

How many times did you pay someone to remove the virus infection from your PC? Removing viruses and malware is not rocket science. There are lots of tools that automatically scan and remove viruses from the system. Then why to pay for this. Yes, you may need to purchase the antivirus tools for this. But, the service repair guys always take extra charge from you.

There are lots of good antivirus and antimalware you can purchase their subscription and clean your PC. All you have to do is to install the antivirus and run the scan. Sometimes, viruses don’t let you download antivirus. To overcome from this situation download the tool on some other computer and then boot your PC in safe mode then install the antivirus. To run the Windows in safe mode press **Ctrl+F8** key during the startup and choose safe mode.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MalwareFox-1.jpg)Install the MalwareFox anti-malware to remove the nasty malware infection from your system.

## Upgrading or Changing Computer’s Part

If you want to upgrade some part on your machine, then you don’t need to pay for it. You can easily do it. Most of the computer’s components are easy to install and remove. Like if you want to upgrade the RAM in your system, then you just have to insert in its slot. It is similar with the hard drive. To upgrade the RAM, you have to know which type of RAM your PC support. To know that right click on the taskbar and choose Task Manager. Click on the Performance Tab, and then click on the Memory. You will see the RAM type on the upper right corner. Now you know which kind of RAM to purchase. Now decide its size, if you want that your PC has 8 GB of RAM and you have one empty slot of RAM, then you can purchase a 4GB of RAM if there are no empty slots then you have to buy 8GB of RAM. If you are not sure how to remove and insert a new RAM or Hard Drive, you can watch videos online. Tons of tutorials will tell you step by step. If you plan to change the hard drive, then you have to install the Windows again. That takes a little bit more efforts, but that is also not hard. Similarly, you can change other parts like SMPS, optical drive, and even motherboard. You don’t need serviceman to do this job.

## Recovering Deleted Files

When you accidentally deleted an important file, and it is not in the recycle bin, then you call so-called data recovery guys to do the job for you. They don’t have magical powers to recover your files. They use some tools to recover the deleted files. So you can use that yourself.![Recovering Deleted Data](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6.png)When you delete a file from the hard drive, it doesn’t get removed immediately. The system just removes its name from the index file. So you cannot find it. Some tools scan for such data and help you to recover them. Such a tool is [Recuva](https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva). It is developed by Piriform and comes in free and paid version. For me, its a life saver. If it doesn’t do the job, then you can switch to some paid recovery software. But before investing money research a little bit about the product. There are lots of fake products in the market.

## Fixing Windows Errors

If you are getting a windows error, then there is no need to call service repair guys. You can fix those errors with yourself with a little bit of research. When you receive an error window provide an error code to identify it. Note down the error code and search about it on the internet. I am sure you will find a solution.![Windows Repair by Tweaking.com](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1.png)If you want a more simple solution, then download a system repair tool. [Windows Repair by Tweaking.com](http://www.tweaking.com/) is such a software. It automatically scans for missing system files and registry entry and fixes them. [Iolo System Mechanic](https://www.iolo.com/products/system-mechanic-professional/) is another useful tool in such cases.

## Reinstalling the Operating System

If nothing is working, then you can reinstall the operating system by yourself. Reinstalling the OS will fix most of your issues. It will [fix the slow down problem](https://www.windowschimp.com/fix-slow-boot/) and also replaces the missing and corrupted system files. Your system will be restored to default settings, and you can have a fresh PC. You can use Windows CD/DVD to reinstall it or also can use inbuilt reset tool. To [reset the Windows 10](https://www.windowschimp.com/factory-reset-windows-10/), right click on the Start button and choose Settings. Now click on Update & Security.
