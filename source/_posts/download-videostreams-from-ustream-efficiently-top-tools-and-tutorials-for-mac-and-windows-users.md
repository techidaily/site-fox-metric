### Brief Introduction to Ustream

Founded in 2007, Ustream.com aims to provide streaming videos. The videos on Ustream.com are categorized into news, sports, music, conferences, movie premieres, live shows, entertainment, interactive games, etc. The most exciting function is that Ustream is a video-broadcasting platform which means you can broadcast your video stream to Ustream, whether it is a commentary clip or an educative video. Ustream gives freedom for users' comment as well as places for creators to post other work. It is a popular platform for common users to create shows for free.

Furthermore, Ustream also has a private-label service named Watershed, which can greatly limit the distribution to selected users. **However, all the videos can only be achieved online, and downloading service is unavailable, so a third-party Ustream Downloader is necessary.**
